**Mem4ristor V6** is a computational implementation of extended FitzHugh-Nagumo dynamics designed to investigate emergent critical states in neuromorphic networks. The model uses "Constitutional Doubt" ($u$) and "Structural Heretics" to maintain phase diversity in scale-free networks, generating robust Chimera states without requiring stochastic noise.

## :microscope: Key Scientific Features

*   **Constitutional Doubt ($u$):** A dynamic state variable that modulates coupling polarity based on local uncertainty, enabling repulsive social coupling when doubt is high.
*   **Structural Heretics:** A subset of nodes with inverted stimulus perception. These act as causal structural walls that prevent consensus collapse.
*   **Levitating Sigmoid Coupling:** Smooth repulsive coupling via $\tanh(\pi(0.5-u)) + \delta$, eliminating the dead zone at $u=0.5$.
*   **Degree-Normalized Coupling:** Per-node coupling $D/\deg(i)$ prevents hub strangulation on Barabási-Albert networks.
*   **Robust Chimera States:** Phase-locked macroscopic state coexisting with spatial diversity, validated across homogeneous and random initial conditions.
*   **Sparse CSR Backend:** Automatic `scipy.sparse` conversion for $N > 1000$, yielding massive memory reductions.
*   **ART (Adaptive Reset Threshold):** Per-node reset threshold modulated by doubt history, preventing fatigue collapse.
*   **Metacognitive Plasticity:** Per-node learning rate modulated by local doubt, enabling adaptive memory consolidation.
*   **Compartimentalised Dynamics:** Multiple sub-personalities coexisting within the same network.
*   **Non-Local Coupling by Doubt Similarity:** Coupling between topologically distant nodes when their doubt states are correlated.

## :rocket: Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cafe-virtuel/Mem4ristor.git
cd Mem4ristor
pip install -e .
```

*Note: The `-e` flag installs in editable mode, allowing you to modify source code without reinstalling.*

## :computer: Usage

### Quick Start (Python API)

```python
from mem4ristor.core import Mem4Network

# Initialize a lattice network (N=100, 15% Heretics)
net = Mem4Network(size=10, heretic_ratio=0.15, seed=42)

# Run simulation for 1000 steps (Cold Start: no external stimulus)
for step in range(1000):
    net.step(I_stimulus=0.0)

# Calculate final entropy (measure of diversity)
print(f"Final System Entropy: {net.calculate_entropy():.4f}")
# See docs/CLAIMS_REGISTER.md for expected values and binning notes
```

### Scale-Free Networks

```python
import networkx as nx

# Create a Barabási-Albert scale-free network
G = nx.barabasi_albert_graph(100, 3, seed=42)
adj = nx.to_numpy_array(G)

# Use degree-linear normalization to prevent hub strangulation
net = Mem4Network(adjacency_matrix=adj, heretic_ratio=0.15,
                  coupling_norm='degree_linear', seed=42)

for step in range(3000):
    net.step(I_stimulus=0.0)

print(f"Scale-Free Entropy: {net.calculate_entropy():.4f}")
# Expected: ~3.18 with this exact snippet (seed=42, BA m=3, 3000 steps, V6.0.0).
```

> **On these two numbers.** They are what the snippets above print *as written* — measured on
> 2026-09-03 from a fresh clone. They are **demonstrations, not claims**: a single seed, and two
> different protocols (10x10 lattice / 1000 steps vs. BA m=3 / 3000 steps), so they must **not**
> be divided by one another to obtain a "recovery ratio" — an earlier version of this README did
> exactly that. The publishable figures are elsewhere, with their seed counts and their
> verification scripts: `H_stable = 4.09 +/- 0.19 bits` over 10 seeds on the 10x10 lattice
> (claim `C01`, see [`docs/CLAIMS_REGISTER.md`](docs/CLAIMS_REGISTER.md)), checked on every push
> by [`tools/preprint_guardian.py`](tools/README.md).

### Running Demos

```bash
# Chimera demo
python experiments/demo_chimera.py
# Produces demo_chimera_output.png

python examples/demo_applied.py
# Produces 5 PNG files
```

## :gear: Configuration

The model is highly configurable via `src/mem4ristor/config.yaml`. You can adjust:

*   **Dynamics:** `a`, `b`, `epsilon` (FHN parameters)
*   **Coupling:** `D` (Strength), `heretic_ratio`, `coupling_norm` (`uniform`, `degree_linear`, `spectral`)
*   **Doubt:** `epsilon_u`, `u_clamp`, `alpha_surprise` (meta-doubt gain)
*   **Hysteresis (V5):** `enabled`, `theta_low`, `theta_high`, `fatigue_rate`
*   **ART (V6):** `art_enabled`, `art_threshold`, `art_window`
*   **Noise:** `sigma_v`

## :test_tube: Testing

The repository includes a comprehensive test suite using `pytest`.

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run only robustness tests

### Experiments — `experiments/`

**Note:** On 2026-08-05, **30 scripts were moved back out of `experiments/scratch/`** (a
gitignored directory) into `experiments/`. Until then, the paths listed below existed in
this README but **not in a clone** — twelve versioned scripts depended on one of them.
Everything listed here is now versioned and present after `git clone`. Purely historical
material remains in `experiments/scratch/` and is *not* part of the repository.
