FAILURE LOG: V3 Scientific Audit & Migration
Date: 2026-02-16
Auditor: Claude Opus 4.6
Orchestrator: Julien Chauvin

=== FAILURES DISCOVERED DURING AUDIT ===

FAIL-01: test_nan_injection_survial accepted nan_count <= 1
  Location: tests/test_robustness.py (v2.9.3)
  Impact: NaN could persist in 1 unit after sanitization
  Root cause: Guard cleaned v but tolerance allowed 1 survivor
  Fix: Strict nan_count == 0

FAIL-02: test_manus_v2.py used print() instead of assert (5 tests)
  Location: tests/test_manus_v2.py (v2.9.3)
  Impact: CI could not detect regressions - tests always "passed"
  Root cause: Tests written as demonstration scripts, not automated checks
  Fix: All print-based checks converted to assert statements

FAIL-03: GUARD 0 did not catch Inf in state variables
  Location: src/mem4ristor/core.py step() method
  Impact: Inf in w[5] persisted through step(), caused NaN propagation via arithmetic
  Root cause: Guard used np.isnan() which misses Inf
  Fix: Changed to ~np.isfinite() with posinf/neginf handling

FAIL-04: benchmark_kuramoto.py topology mismatch
  Location: experiments/benchmark_kuramoto.py
  Impact: Comparison between grid (k=4) and all-to-all was structurally unfair
  Root cause: Kuramoto used default all-to-all coupling, Mem4ristor used 2D lattice
  Fix: Both models now use same 2D lattice adjacency matrix

FAIL-05: benchmark_kuramoto.py invalid voltage-to-phase mapping
  Location: experiments/benchmark_kuramoto.py compute_order_parameter_v()
  Impact: R (order parameter) was computed for FHN voltage using linear phase rescaling
  Root cause: FHN is an excitable medium, not a phase oscillator - mapping is unphysical
  Fix: R computed only for Kuramoto; comparison uses entropy and variance instead

FAIL-06: Preprint "Law of 15%" overclaim
  Location: docs/preprint.tex
  Impact: Claimed topological invariance contradicted by own LIMIT-02 (scale-free failure)
  Root cause: Observation on regular lattices presented as universal law
  Fix: Renamed to "Empirical Threshold of 15%", removed "topologically invariant"

FAIL-07: Preprint "CCC Validation" overclaim
  Location: docs/preprint.tex
  Impact: Retrospective curve-fitting presented as forward validation
  Root cause: No raw CCC data used; parameters hand-tuned to match known outcomes
  Fix: Renamed to "CCC Illustration"

FAIL-08: dt inconsistency across code and documentation
  Location: docs/preprint.tex, src/mem4ristor/config.yaml
  Impact: Preprint referenced dt=0.01 and dt=0.1 while code used dt=0.05
  Root cause: Stale references from earlier versions not updated
  Fix: Harmonized to dt=0.05 everywhere
