# Preprint Polish (Grok Review) - Failure Log
# Date: 2026-02-11
# Context: Addressing reviewer feedback before HAL/arXiv submission

## FAILURE 1: Version Inconsistency (v2.6 vs v2.9.3)
- 34 instances of "v2.6" in preprint.tex while title said v2.9.3
- Root cause: Title updated in earlier commit but body text not updated
- Resolution: Bulk replace v2.6 → v2.9.3 across entire file
- Side effect: "v2.6--v2.6" range became "v2.9.3--v2.9.3", fixed to "v2.0--v2.9.3"

## FAILURE 2: Abstract H value without units
- H ≈ 1.56 stated without specifying "bits" or the measurement basis
- Root cause: Initial drafting assumed reader familiarity
- Resolution: Added "(Shannon entropy over 5 cognitive states)" parenthetical

## FAILURE 3: S₀ estimate unsourced
- Intra-group entropy S₀ ≈ 0.8-1.0 bits stated without justification
- Root cause: Value was estimated informally from simulation observations
- Resolution: Added explicit sourcing from intra-group variance in long-run simulations (T > 10,000 steps)
