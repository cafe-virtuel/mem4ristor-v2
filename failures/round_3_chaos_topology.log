[2026-02-13] ROUND 3 ATTACKS
---------------------------
Attack Vectors:
1. Topological Hallucination: Standard `eigh` failed on non-symmetric directed graphs.
   - Fix: Enforced symmetry check in `get_spectral_gap`.
2. Stiffness DoS: `solve_rk45` froze on stiff equations (time-scale separation).
   - Fix: Added `max_step` limit and `nfev` warning.
3. Chaos Injection: `step()` accepted chaotic objects breaking determinism.
   - Fix: Added strict type checking for inputs.

Status: FIXED.
Verification: Passed.
Exploits: tests/exploits/attack_*.py committed for regression testing.
