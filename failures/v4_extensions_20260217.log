FAILURE LOG: V4 Adaptive Extensions
Date: 2026-02-17
Auditor: Claude Opus 4.6
Orchestrator: Julien Chauvin
Source: Analysis by Manus AI Agent (vulnerability report on V3)

=== VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED (Manus Analysis) ===

VULN-01: Hub Strangulation in Scale-Free Networks
  Description: On Barabási-Albert graphs, heretic units relegated to
    periphery have their dissent signal averaged out by hub nodes
    before reaching the rest of the network.
  Impact: Entropy collapse despite 15% heretic ratio on complex topologies.
  Severity: STRUCTURAL
  Fix: Doubt-driven rewiring (V4) - high-doubt units disconnect from
    consensual neighbors and reconnect to random non-neighbors.

VULN-02: Rigid Hyperparameters (No Meta-Plasticity)
  Description: epsilon_u is a fixed constant. When external stimulus
    regime changes radically (e.g., constant → white noise), the system
    can get stuck in permanent doubt (u≈1) or blind certainty (u≈0).
  Impact: No adaptation to changing environments.
  Severity: FUNCTIONAL
  Fix: Adaptive Meta-Doubt (V4) - epsilon_u modulated by social surprise.
    ε_u_eff(i) = ε_u × clip(1 + α_surprise × σ_social(i), 1, cap)

VULN-03: Numerical Overflow in Meta-Doubt Under Fuzzing
  Description: When sigma_social is astronomically large (fuzzing inputs),
    alpha_s * sigma_social overflows float64 before np.clip can cap it.
  Impact: RuntimeWarning (overflow encountered in scalar multiply)
  Severity: LOW (result is still correct due to clip, but warning is noisy)
  Fix: Pre-clamp sigma_social to 100.0 before multiplication.

=== FIXES APPLIED ===

FIX-01: Adaptive Meta-Doubt (Bayesian Surprise)
  File: src/mem4ristor/core.py (step() and solve_rk45())
  Mechanism: ε_u_eff(i) = ε_u × clip(1 + α × σ_social_safe(i), 1, cap)
  Default params: alpha_surprise=2.0, surprise_cap=5.0
  Backward compatible: alpha_surprise=0 → exact V3 behavior
  Tests: 5 new tests in test_v4_extensions.py

FIX-02: Doubt-Driven Topological Rewiring
  File: src/mem4ristor/core.py (Mem4Network class)
  Mechanism: When u_i > threshold, disconnect from most consensual
    neighbor (min |v_i - v_j|), reconnect to random non-neighbor.
  Properties: Degree-neutral, symmetric, per-unit cooldown
  Default params: rewire_threshold=0.8, rewire_cooldown=50
  Limitation: Only works with explicit adjacency matrices (not stencil grids)
  Tests: 7 new tests + 2 integration tests in test_v4_extensions.py

FIX-03: Overflow Guard for Meta-Doubt
  File: src/mem4ristor/core.py (step())
  Mechanism: sigma_social_safe = clip(sigma_social, 0, 100) before
    computing alpha_s * sigma_social
  Tests: Passes fuzzing suite with -W error::RuntimeWarning

=== TEST RESULTS ===

Full suite: 48 tests, 46 passed, 2 xfailed, 0 warnings
New tests: 15/15 passed (test_v4_extensions.py)
Regression: 0 failures on existing 33 tests

=== REPO CLEANUP (same commit) ===

- .gitignore: Deduplicated (was copy-pasted twice), added egg-info, synctex, nul, pycache
- Removed: archives/ (4 legacy debug scripts), bicameral_trace.png (orphaned),
  src/mem4ristor.egg-info/ (build artifacts)
- Reorganized: FINAL_SCIENTIFIC_REPORT_V26.md → docs/scientific_report_v26.md
  CAFE-VIRTUEL-LIMITATIONS.md → docs/limitations.md
  docs/reports → docs/observation_report_v23.md
- VERSION: v3.0.0 → v3.1.0
