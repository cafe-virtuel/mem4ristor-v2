FAILURE LOG: Preprint Update to v3.1.0
Date: 2026-02-17
Auditor: Claude Opus 4.6
Orchestrator: Julien Chauvin

=== ISSUES FOUND IN PREPRINT (pre-update) ===

ISSUE-01: Stale kernel reference
  Location: Section 2.3 (Constitutional Doubt Dynamics)
  Problem: Text referenced "(1-2u) filtering" — the V2 linear kernel
  Fix: Replaced with "Levitating Sigmoid kernel tanh(π(0.5-u)) + δ"

ISSUE-02: Missing plasticity term in dw equation
  Location: Section 2.1 (Neuromorphic-Inspired Dynamics), Eq. (2)
  Problem: dw/dt showed only FHN term, missing dw_plasticity
  Fix: Added "+ dw_plasticity" to Eq. (2)

ISSUE-03: Fixed epsilon_u in du equation
  Location: Section 2.1, Eq. (3) and Section 2.3
  Problem: du/dt used fixed ε_u, inconsistent with V3.1.0 adaptive code
  Fix: Changed to ε_{u,eff}(i)/τ_u with forward reference to Section 6

ISSUE-04: Duplicate "External validation" bullet
  Location: Section 4.1 (Core Principles list)
  Problem: Same bullet appeared twice
  Fix: Removed duplicate

ISSUE-05: Version references outdated
  Location: Title, abstract, introduction, interface contract, conclusion
  Problem: All references said v3.0.0 for the current model
  Fix: Updated to v3.1.0 where referring to current version

ISSUE-06: No documentation of V4 mechanisms
  Location: Missing entirely
  Problem: Code had Meta-Doubt and Rewiring but preprint didn't describe them
  Fix: Added Section 6 "Adaptive Extensions (v3.1.0)" with full equations

ISSUE-07: Missing bibliography entry
  Location: Section 6.2 referenced [gross2008] but entry didn't exist
  Fix: Added Gross & Blasius (2008) adaptive networks reference

=== RESULT ===

Preprint recompiled: 20 pages, 0 LaTeX errors, 0 undefined references.
All v3.1.0 code mechanisms now documented in the paper.
