# Antigravity Audit v2.9.3 — Failure Evidence Log
# Date: 2026-02-10
# Auditor: Antigravity (Gemini 2.5 Pro)
# Context: Full audit of Mem4ristor codebase

## FAILURE 1: NaN Propagation via Coupling
- State variables (v, w, u) could become NaN and propagate through network
- Root cause: No guards on state variables before coupling computation
- Impact: Complete network corruption in long simulations
- Fix: NaN guards added to v, w, u at start of step()

## FAILURE 2: Dead-Border Artifact (36%)
- Stencil Laplacian used zero-padding, creating dead borders
- Root cause: Missing boundary condition handling
- Impact: Border elements disconnected from network (36% of 10x10 grid)
- Fix: Periodic (toroidal) and Neumann boundary conditions implemented

## FAILURE 3: Entropy Misalignment
- calculate_entropy() used uniform bins [-5, 5]
- get_states() used cognitive bins [-1.5, -0.8, 0.8, 1.5]
- Impact: Entropy metric measured different states than reported
- Fix: Aligned entropy bins with cognitive state thresholds

## FAILURE 4: Global RNG Pollution
- Mem4Network used np.random.seed() (global state)
- Impact: Non-deterministic behavior with multiple instances
- Fix: Replaced with local np.random.RandomState(seed)

## FAILURE 5: Preprint H-Value Overclaim
- Claimed H = 1.99 bits (theoretical maximum for 5 bins = 2.32)
- Actual measured: H ≈ 1.56 bits
- Impact: Overstated diversity performance by 28%
- Fix: Corrected to H ≈ 1.56 with qualification

## FAILURE 6: Lyapunov Candidate Rejection
- Quadratic candidate V = 1/2 v^2 + ... violated dV/dt <= 0 in 53% of steps
- Root cause: System is limit cycle, not fixed-point attractor
- Impact: Cannot claim formal stability via standard Lyapunov
- Documented honestly as negative result
