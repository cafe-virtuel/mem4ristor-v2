FAILURE LOG: Reviewer-Suggested Fixes
Date: 2026-02-17
Auditor: Claude Opus 4.6 (responding to external LLM review)
Orchestrator: Julien Chauvin

=== ISSUES FOUND BY EXTERNAL REVIEWER ===

ISSUE-01: Empty test_plasticity_activation
  Location: tests/test_kernel.py
  Problem: Test body was just `assert True` — no quantitative validation
  Fix: Rewrote with two identical-v pairs (different u), checking dw difference > 0.01
  Result: Plasticity contribution of ~0.1 correctly detected for high-doubt units

ISSUE-02: O(N²) Laplacian rebuild on every rewire
  Location: src/mem4ristor/core.py, Mem4Network._doubt_driven_rewire()
  Problem: Full _rebuild_laplacian() called after each single edge swap
  Fix: Added _update_laplacian_incremental(i, j, k) — updates 6 entries of L in O(1)
  Result: New test confirms incremental L matches full rebuild to machine precision

ISSUE-03: Missing Fiedler value verification post-rewiring
  Location: tests/test_v4_extensions.py (missing)
  Problem: No test verified that rewiring preserves graph connectivity
  Fix: Added test_spectral_gap_preserved_after_rewiring — checks Fiedler > 0
  Side-fix: Added bridge protection in rewire — won't disconnect neighbor j if degree ≤ 1

ISSUE-04: "Bayesian Surprise" misnomer
  Location: core.py docstring/comments, preprint.tex, test_v4_extensions.py
  Problem: The mechanism is social surprise (σ_social from neighbors), not Bayesian surprise
  Fix: Renamed all occurrences to "Social Surprise"

=== RESULT ===

All 48 tests pass (+ 2 xfail). 0 failures.
Rewiring now preserves connectivity (bridge protection) and uses O(1) Laplacian updates.
