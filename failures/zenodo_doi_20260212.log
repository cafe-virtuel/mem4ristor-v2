# Failure Log: HAL Rejection & Zenodo Pivot
# Date: 2026-02-12
# Author: Julien Chauvin (Independent Researcher)

## Issue 1: HAL Submission Rejected (hal-05506167v1)
- HAL moderator rejected the deposit
- Reason: No doctoral degree, no institutional affiliation, no prior publications
- HAL policy requires at least a doctoral student affiliated with a recognized institution
- The scientific content was NOT evaluated — only administrative credentials

## Resolution: Zenodo DOI Published
- Pivoted to Zenodo (CERN) — no gatekeeping on academic status
- DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18620597
- URL: https://zenodo.org/records/18620597
- Published: 2026-02-12, immediate availability

## Issue 2: README and CITATION.cff missing DOI
- Repository lacked any reference to the published preprint DOI
- Fix: Added Zenodo DOI badge to README.md, updated CITATION.cff with DOI field

## Lesson Learned
- HAL is NOT open to independent researchers without institutional backing
- Zenodo (CERN) is the correct platform for non-affiliated researchers
- Always have a backup publication channel
