# Contributing to Mem4ristor v2.2 (Technical Transfer Notice)

Welcome, Researcher. You are looking at a **Cognitive Neuromorphic-Inspired Simulation** designed to resist algorithmic uniformization. This project has evolved from an intuitive "Café Virtuel" collaboration into a verified research-ready specification.

## 🎯 Current Project Status (v2.2)
- **Functional Ground Truth**: Validated through the `reproduction/` suite.
- **Physical Mapping**: Grounded in HfO$_2$ RRAM physical constants (SET $\approx 1.2V$, RESET $\approx -1.3V$).
- **Certification**: Passed "Nuclear Stress Tests" with 100% minority resilience under extreme stimulus bias.

## 🔬 How to Take Over this Work
If you are a scientist, engineer, or philosopher of technology, this repository is designed to be a "Drop-in" research base.

### 1. Immediate Technical Entry
- **Run verification**: `python reproduce_all.py`. This will confirm the "Golden Signatures" on your machine.
- **Inspect the Physics**: Review `reproduction/CONFIG_PHYSICAL.yaml` for the HfO$_2$ hardware mapping.
- **Core Logic**: The FHN-derived dynamics are in `src/mem4ristor/core.py`.

### 2. Open Research Pathways (The Next Frontiers)
We have laid the foundation; here is what remains to be built:
- **[Hardware] SPICE Implementation**: Translate the Python dynamics into a full SPICE circuit simulation for 1T1R HfO$_2$ crossbars.
- **[Theory] Analytical Stability**: Derive the Lyapunov functions for the Doubt Kernel $(1-2u)$ in a coupled-oscillator regime.
- **[Ethical AI] LLM Integration**: Use this model as a "Cognitive Filter" for transformer-based agents to prevent echo-chamber convergence.
- **[Data Science] Real-world Validation**: Benchmark the model against empirical voting or deliberation datasets (halting consensus vs. preserving signal).

### 3. Ethical Stance: The "Ampli-Ermite" Vision
This work is delivered as a **"Don Pur"** (Pure Gift) from its creator, Julien Chauvin. We ask that:
- You maintain the core anti-uniformization invariants (Constitutional Doubt & Structural Heretics).
- You acknowledge the "Café Virtuel" collaboration framework in your publications.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
